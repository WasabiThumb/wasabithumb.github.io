                <p>
                    You have reached the portfolio page of the 9+ year coding hobbyist that the internet knows as
                    "Wasabi". Under this alias I have developed several passion projects, picking up skills with
                    many programming languages & development software along the way. I developed a love for Java, Kotlin
                    and object-oriented programming in general, but still appreciate and excel at languages like
                    JavaScript, Python and Lua where I got my start. I've been exploring more low-level languages
                    like C/C++ and Rust as of late, using them to create a game engine.
                </p>

                    This website has several interactive demos involving creative math, algorithms and methods to operate
                    efficiently. The hope is to give the site visual appeal through the beauty of math, while implicitly
                    communicating to informed viewers the level of diligence each demo entails. In any case, the source
                    code with 50 files and counting is available for anyone to see on GitHub.
